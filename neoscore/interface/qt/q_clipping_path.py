class QClippingPath(QGraphicsPathItem):

    """A QGraphicsPathItem extension supporting horizontal path clipping.

    Works like a ``QGraphicsPathItem`` except that it renders a
    horizontal slice of the path. Rather than rendering the entire
    path, renders the region starting at a given ``clip_start_x`` and
    extending for a given ``clip_width``. This rendered region is
    shifted leftward, so it appears at the path's root position. This
    is useful for splitting a path into horizontal chunks and
    rendering them in different positions, for instance when drawing a
    staff which appears on multiple lines.

    ``clip_start_x`` and ``clip_width`` should not take into account
    scaling. For example if a rendered region of 50 points is required
    on a path with a scale of 2, ``clip_width=50`` should be passed.

    While the Qt superclass is mutable, this is intended to be treated
    immutably. Mutations after instantation will result unexpected
    behavior. Object mutations at higher abstraction levels should
    result in new Qt objects created.

    Internally, the clipping implementation is rather subtle in how it
    integrates with Qt's coordinate and painter systems. The item's
    bounding rect is adjusted to match the requested clip region. At
    render time, the painter translates its coordinate system leftward
    by the (internally scale-adjusted) ``clip_start_x``. The painter's
    clip rect is then derived from the item's bounding rect, but
    shifted rightward to cancel out the painter's translation. These
    actions are all automatically scaled as necessary, since the scale
    is applied to the QClippingPath, not the painter.

    Note that clipping behavior does not play well with rotated items,
    and no API guarantees are currently given about it.
