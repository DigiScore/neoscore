    This class does not define an actual concert pitch, MIDI code, pitch class, etc.
    associated with it. Users building notation systems on it can decide whether this
    represents a concert pitch or a written one. Neoscore's ``western`` module treats it
    mostly as a written pitch, unconditionally writing provided accidentals regardless
    of context and key signatures.

    The class supports a helpful shorthand for standard western 12-EDO pitches inspired
    by Lilypond's pitch notation; see :obj:`.Pitch.from_str`.

    Extended accidentals are fully supported by passing arbitrary SMuFL glyph names to
    the ``accidental`` attribute.

        The pitch shorthand is inspired by Lilypond's. It consists of three parts:
        a pitch letter, an optional accidental, and an optional octave mark.

        * Pitch letters are the standard ``c`` through ``b`` letters.
        * The accidental may be ``f`` or ``b`` for flat, ``s`` or ``#`` for sharp, ``n`` for
          natural, ``ss`` or ``x`` for double-sharp, and ``ff`` or ``bb`` for double-flat.
        * The octave indication is given by a series of apostrophes (``'``)
          or commas (``,``), where each apostrophe increases the pitch by an octave,
          and each comma decreases it. All octave transformations are relative to
          the octave starting at middle-C. The absence of an octave indicator means a
          pitch is within the octave starting at middle-C. (Note that this differs from
          Lilypond's notation, which starts at the octave *below* middle-C.)

        Some examples:

        * Middle-C: ``c``
        * The B directly below that: ``b,``
        * The C one octave below middle-C: ``c,``
        * The E-flat above middle-C: ``ef`` or ``eb``
        * The F-sharp above middle-C: ``fs`` or ``f#``
        * The G-double-sharp above middle-C: ``fx`` or ``fss``
        * The A-double-flat above the treble staff: ``aff'`` or ``abb'``
