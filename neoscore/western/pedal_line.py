    """A line-style pedal marking with optional half-lift (^) marks.

    The mark begins with an upward crook, continues as a horizontal
    line interrupted with optional half-lift upward triangular marks,
    and terminates with another upward crook.

    The object's position is that of the top of the opening crook;
    this y-axis position is also the height two which the half-lift
    marks extend. The main line of the path is drawn 1 staff unit
    below this position.

    A list of half-lift x-axis positions may be provided as either
    simple x-axis Unit values (relative to the line's start position)
    or as 2-tuples of x-axis positions and position parents:

    >>> PedalLine(start=(Mm(10), staff.unit(8)), start_parent=staff,
    ...           end_x=Mm(200), end_parent=None,

    ...               (Mm(1), some_chord)]  # 1 mm right of some_chord
    ...          ) # doctest: +SKIP

    While this is a path, it requires a music font from which to
    derive its appearance.
