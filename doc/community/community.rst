Neoscore was principally developed by `Andrew Yoon <https://andrewyoon.art>`_, originally begun in 2016 at `The Recurse Center <https://www.recurse.com/>`_ then revived and released in 2022 with substantial support from `Craig Vear <https://www.dmu.ac.uk/about-dmu/academic-staff/art-design-humanities/craig-vear/craig-vear.aspx>`_ and the `DigiScore <https://digiscore.dmu.ac.uk/>`_ research project. Additional support was provided by `Prashanth Thattai Ravikumar <https://github.com/prashanthtr>`_. Many of neoscore's design choices were informed by the excellent open source notation projects `Abjad <https://github.com/Abjad/abjad>`_, `Lilypond <https://lilypond.org/index.html>`_, and `MuseScore <https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/>`_.

The Digital Score project (DigiScore) is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. ERC-2020-COG - 101002086).
