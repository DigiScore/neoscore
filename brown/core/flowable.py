Extremely important object in brown

Flowables will by far be the most common form of object

Flowables can be nested within one another, having an arbitrary flow direction
(initial implementation will be horizontally flowing top to bottom, per typical
western style, but later implementations should be more general)

Examples of flowables:
* Pages?
* Systems
* Staves
* Any kind of spanner
* Almost all path objects
* Text objects
