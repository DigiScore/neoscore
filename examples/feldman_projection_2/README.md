# Feldman's Grid Notation

This is an involved example score demonstrating how you can build sophisticated managed notation systems on top of neoscore. In this example, we implement Morton Feldman's grid notation system and engrave the first page and a half of his piece, _Projection 2_.

To run the score, run `main.py`.

Note that this piece is (c) Edition Peters 1951, used here under fair use. The project's open source license does not extend to the musical contents of the piece.
